"Transform the entire website into a high-end Engineering Academy platform, using the structural layout and UX hierarchy of 'beam.co.ae' as the blueprint, but reskinned with a 'Dark Industrial' engineering aesthetic.

1. Core Architectural Layout (Inspired by BEAM):

Institutional Header: A clean, fixed navigation bar with the 'Ahmed Academy' logo on the right (RTL). Include a prominent 'Register Interest' or 'انضم الآن' button in high-contrast orange.

Hero Slider: Replace the BEAM school images with a high-fidelity, interactive 3D Exploded View of a mechanical system. Use the same 'split-screen' or 'centered hero' spacing as BEAM, but with technical wireframes.

Animated Statistics: Replicate the BEAM 'Stats' section (e.g., 0+ Students, 0+ Modules) using a ticker-counter animation. Label them with engineering metrics like 'ساعات التدريب التقني' (Technical Training Hours) and 'النماذج الهندسية' (Engineering Models).

2. Terminology & Content Logic (STRICT):

Global Change: Replace every instance of 'دورة/دورات' with 'مادة/مواد'.

Removal: Delete all UI components, pages, or database fields related to 'Certificates' or 'الشهادات'.

Sectioning: Instead of 'Our Schools', name the section 'المسارات الهندسية' (Engineering Tracks) or 'المواد المتوفرة' (Available Materials).

3. Visual Design System (Engineering Spirit):

Color Palette: Swap BEAM's corporate blue/white for Deep Obsidian (#0A0A0A), Mechanical Grey (#2C2C2C), and Safety Orange (#FF4F00) as the primary action color.

Typography: Use 'Monument Extended' for high-impact titles (like BEAM’s main headers) and 'JetBrains Mono' for technical sub-labels to give it a 'Blueprint' feel.

UI Components: Use the same grid-card layout seen on BEAM’s 'Our Schools' section, but style them as 'Technical Data Sheets'. Instead of photos of buildings, use isometric 3D icons of gears, circuits, or structural trusses.

4. Global Site Effects:

Scroll Behavior: Implement smooth scroll-triggered animations for all sections.

Glassmorphism: Use the frosted-glass effect for the 'Contact Us' (تواصل معنا) form and informational cards, ensuring the blueprint grid is visible underneath.

RTL Support: Ensure the entire site is natively optimized for Arabic, with fonts, alignments, and the sidebar/navigation perfectly mirrored.

5. Engineering 'Values' Section:

Replace BEAM’s values (Integrity, Compassion) with 'Engineering Excellence' values: الدقة (Precision), الكفاءة (Efficiency), and الابتكار (Innovation), using technical icons instead of icons of people.
